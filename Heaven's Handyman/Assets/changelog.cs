	started the process of working on my Capstone Project for the Fall 2015 semester. 
	Super excited for this, hopefully that excitement will last. 

	changes made: 
	created a new repository on GitHub that will serve as my way of backing things up 
	and keeping changes made to the project current

	made it so that I can commit changes to the repository from my local computer

	imported 2d Toolkit asset package

	started working on the movement script for the basic representation of the character


	9/13/15: 

	changes made: 

	finished the basic player controls
	added a really nice follow camera
	tested it out myself and am happy with how the test character controls
	had other people test it out, they also seemed happy with the control scheme
	started working on enemy concept art and importing them into the project
	created prefab for the test character so I won't lose the values I set for the movement
	basic enemy art completed for: Bimby the Bomb, Generic Flying Eye Bat, Floating Ram Skull, 
	and Earth Snake. 


	9/14/15: 

	changes made: 

	added another basic enemy concept: Scary Mask
	messed around with putting a circle collider on Bimby the Bomb to see how
	it would look in game. 
	started working on the wall of fire that is supposed to be chasing the player.'
	basic chasing framework for the wall completed. 
	added some logic onto Bimby the Bomb that allows him to kill the player on Collision.


	learned about the headache that is working with unity's 2d collison system
	
	9/15/15: 
	changes made:

	started working on implementing the code for the other enemies

	Floating Ram Skull will eventually shoot fireballs :done
	Earth Snake will eventually burst out of the Earth when player gets near
	Generic Flying Bat will fly from right to left across the screen. 
	Scary Mask will fly from left to right across the screen. 

	added a trail renderer to the player to see how it looked
	added a code snippet that checks for the player's y-position 
	and reloads the level if the player goes below the y-position of the moving wall. 
	added beeping sound to Bimby the Bomb and a distance counter that tracks how
	far he is away from the player and begins playing a beeping sound when the player is 
	close enough and Bimby collides with an object.
